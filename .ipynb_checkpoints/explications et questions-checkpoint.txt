part 1
first we created dataframe
randint to generate random integers we pass a min value and a max value and size so we limit how many integers we want to generate
part 2
we load csv file we geneated in part 1
Nan for the first month because basically it's firts month
quarters are used to split the year into 4 parts thats simplify our analysis just like tnhis example
Pandas Quarter

3
In pandas, you can easily extract the quarter of a date using the dt.quarter attribute. This is useful for time series analysis where you need to group data by quarters.

Example

import pandas as pd

# Create a Series of dates
s = pd.Series(["2020-01-01", "2020-04-01", "2020-07-01", "2020-10-01"])
s = pd.to_datetime(s)

# Extract the quarter
quarters = s.dt.quarter
print(quarters)
Copier
Output:

0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
dtype: int64

part 3 

so pivot table is used to aggregate data from a long data to a easy understandable report and pivot table needs 4 elements to work

index is rows basically

columns
values : the data we want to calculate in our example are productts
calculation : the aggregation function we used here is mean that calculates the average of all sales values


part 4


the idxmax gives us the indexlabel of the highest value in the total_sales column

the df.loc uses that index to retrive the entire row with all columns



sum calculates the sum of all values of products A B . . . .

max gives maximum

strftime is just a formatter used to tell python how to display time or date (only usable with dates and time)

Part 5 – Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib:

This part shows how to visualize monthly sales data using different types of plots to better understand trends and sales distribution by product.

1)Prepare the data for trend plots

    Select the Month column and the product columns (Product_A, Product_B, etc.) for       individual sales plotting.

    Convert the DataFrame to long format using melt().

      id_vars=['Month'] → columns to keep fixed (here, months).

      value_vars=products → columns to transform into a single Sales column.

      var_name='Product' and value_name='Sales' → names for the new columns.

   This is necessary because Seaborn works better with long-form DataFrames.

2)Plot monthly trends per product (Lineplot)

   sns.lineplot plots sales over months for each product.

   hue='Product' → separates lines by product with different colors.

   marker='o' adds a marker at each month for visibility.

   plt.xticks(rotation=45) → rotates x-axis labels to avoid overlap.

3)Stacked bar chart

   Use df.set_index('Month')[products] to prepare data.

   kind='bar', stacked=True → shows each product’s contribution to total monthly sales.

   Annotate the best month (identified in Part 4) with plt.text() using       best_month_sales and best_month_name.

4)Heatmap of sales (Product vs Month)

   sns.heatmap visualizes the density and volume of sales.

   .T transposes the DataFrame so products are on the vertical axis and months on the      horizontal axis.

   annot=True displays the sales numbers on the heatmap.

   cmap='YlGnBu' sets a color palette for visual clarity.

5)Sales distribution per product (Boxplot + Swarmplot)

  Boxplot → shows median, interquartile range (IQR), and outliers.

  Swarmplot → overlays individual sales points to see actual distribution.

  This combination helps identify:

  Consistency of sales (small spread = stable sales).

   Outliers (points far from the median).

6)Final Insight

  Using print(), we extract information from the visualization:

  Median sales per product.

  Product with the highest median, indicating stable and strong performance.
