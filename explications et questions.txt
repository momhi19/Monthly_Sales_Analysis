part 1
first we created dataframe
randint to generate random integers we pass a min value and a max value and size so we limit how many integers we want to generate
part 2
we load csv file we geneated in part 1
Nan for the first month because basically it's firts month
quarters are used to split the year into 4 parts thats simplify our analysis just like tnhis example
Pandas Quarter
1

In pandas, you can easily extract the quarter of a date using the dt.quarter attribute. This is useful for time series analysis where you need to group data by quarters.

Example

import pandas as pd

# Create a Series of dates
s = pd.Series(["2020-01-01", "2020-04-01", "2020-07-01", "2020-10-01"])
s = pd.to_datetime(s)

# Extract the quarter
quarters = s.dt.quarter
print(quarters)
Copier
Output:

0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
dtype: int64

part 3 

so pivot table is used to aggregate data from a long data to a easy understandable report and pivot table needs 4 elements to work

index is rows basically

columns
values : the data we want to calculate in our example are productts
calculation : the aggregation function we used here is mean that calculates the average of all sales values


part 4


the idxmax gives us the indexlabel of the highest value in the total_sales column

the df.loc uses that index to retrive the entire row with all columns



sum calculates the sum of all values of products A B . . . .

max gives maximum

strftime is just a formatter used to tell python how to display time or date (only usable with dates and time)
